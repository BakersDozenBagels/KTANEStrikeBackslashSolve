  title: Strike\Solve
  author: BakersDozenBagels
  description: "Press: Strike; Solve.\r\n\r\nCreated to fit the theme of \"Three-Sentence
    Manual,\" although this would also work as three words (with clarification).\r\n\r\nTP
    support would be very simple to add, although this would be very difficult to
    score (plus it's me so it isn't happening anyways).\r\n\r\nManual available as
    a PDF or in its entirety here:\r\n\r\nPressing the button will cause the module
    to strike, then if it hasn't already, to solve.\r\nStrikes from this module will
    not detonate the bomb for reaching or exceeding the bomb's strike limit.\r\n\r\nSource:
    https://github.com/BakersDozenBagels/KTANEStrikeBackslashSolve\r\n\r\nFor the
    record, this took three hours to make."
